# Create a List of Album Names and Album URIs

This section demonstrates how to create a list of album names and their corresponding Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Indicators). This guide will use two sample  albums, "Melodrama" and "Pure Heroine" as examples.

### 1. Setting up Spotify API Authentication

First, you need to authenticate your application with Spotify:

- Declare variables for your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret. You can find these on your Spotify Developer Account dashboard.
- Replace 'YOUR-CLIENT-ID' and 'YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET' with your actual Client ID and Client Secret.
    
    ```python
    client_id = 'YOUR-CLIENT-ID'
    client_secret = 'YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET'
    ```
    
- Use these credentials to authenticate your requests to the Spotify API. Run the cell to ensure there are no errors.

### 2. Finding and Storing Album URIs

A Spotify URI uniquely identifies a Spotify resource (album, artist, playlist, etc.).

- To find an album's URI:
a. Open Spotify and navigate to the  album of choice.
b. Click the three dots beneath the album name.
c. Choose "Share" and hover over "Copy Album Link".
d. Press the Option (Alt) key on your keyboard.
e. Select "Copy Album URI".
- Store the album URIs in a list. For example:
    
    ```python
    album_uris = ['spotify:album:6rnzvZhe3PA57xKcKLRtJ6', 'spotify:album:4oCGmYsAQOWt2ACWTpNU']
    ```
    

### 3. Retrieving Album Data with Spotipy

Use Spotipy's `albums` function to fetch album data:

- Initialize the Spotify client with your credentials:
    
    ```python
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials
    import spotipy
    
    client_credentials = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id, client_secret)
    sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials)
    ```
    
- Retrieve album data by passing the list of album URIs to the `albums` function:
    
    ```python
    get_album = sp.albums(album_uris)
    ```
    
- This function will return a wealth of information about the albums, which you can then process and use in your data frame.

### 4. Preparing Lists for Album Data

Create two empty lists to store album names and their URIs:

```python
lorde_album_names = []  # List for album names
lorde_album_uris = []   # List for album URIs
```

### 5. Extracting Album Names and URIs

Iterate over each album in the album URIs list, extracting and appending the album name and URI to the respective lists:

```python
for i, album in enumerate(get_album['albums']):
    # Extracting the album name
    album_name = album['name']
    lorde_album_names.append(album_name)

    # Extracting the album URI
    album_uri = album['uri']
    lorde_album_uris.append(album_uri)
```

- The Spotify data is provided in JSON format. The album name is located under the key `"name"`.
- To access the album name, we use `get_album['albums'][i]['name']`.
- The same approach is applied to retrieve the album's URI.

### 6. Verifying the Extraction Process

To ensure that the extraction process works correctly, you can run the following code:

```python
print("Album Names:", lorde_album_names)
print("Album URIs:", lorde_album_uris)
```

- This code will display the lists of album names and URIs, confirming that the data has been successfully extracted and stored.

### Note on Viewing Album Data

To explore the complete dataset returned by Spotify, you can run the following code:

```python
import json
print(json.dumps(get_album, indent=4))  # This will print the data in a formatted JSON structure
```

- This will display the entire JSON data structure returned by Spotify, allowing you to see all the values and details of each album.

# Extract All the Tracks From the Album List

The objective of this step is to construct a dictionary that encapsulates all albums, including each track and its associated data. We will develop a function to extract and store tracks from a given list of albums.

### 1. Initializing the Storage Structure

Start by creating an empty dictionary to hold the album data and its tracks:

```python
lorde_albums = {}
```

### 2. Defining the Extraction Function

Construct a function to extract track data from an album URI:

- Define a function named `lorde_songs` which takes `album` as a parameter.
- Within the function, create a dictionary structure for each album to store track details like album name, track number, ID, name, and URI.
    
    ```python
    def lorde_songs(album):
        lorde_albums[album] = {
            'album': [],
            'track_number': [],
            'id': [],
            'name': [],
            'uri': []
        }
    ```
    

### 3. Extracting Track Data

Use Spotipy's `album_tracks` function to fetch the album's tracks:

- Assign the result of `sp.album_tracks(album_id)` to a variable `tracks`. This function retrieves the album's track catalog.
    
    ```python
    tracks = sp.album_tracks(album)
    ```
    
- Iterate over the `tracks['items']` to extract and append the necessary data to the corresponding lists in the dictionary.
    
    ```python
    for track in tracks['items']:
        lorde_albums[album]['album'].append(lorde_album_names[album_count])
        lorde_albums[album]['track_number'].append(track['track_number'])
        lorde_albums[album]['id'].append(track['id'])
        lorde_albums[album]['name'].append(track['name'])
        lorde_albums[album]['uri'].append(track['uri'])
    ```
    
- Note that `tracks['items']` refers to the array containing track information in the Spotify album JSON data.

### 4. Implementing the Album Count

Introduce an `album_count` variable to track the current album index in the list:

```python
album_count = 0
```

- This variable is incremented in the loop to align the album name with the corresponding tracks.

### 5. Applying the Function to Each Album URI

Now, iterate over the album URIs, applying the `lorde_songs` function to each:

```python
for album_uri in lorde_album_uris:
    lorde_songs(album_uri)
    album_count += 1
```

- Ensure that the variable used in the `lorde_songs` call matches the parameter in the function definition.

### 6. Testing the Functionality

Execute the cell to confirm that the function operates correctly and the data is being stored as intended.

# Extract Audio Features

In this step, we aim to enrich our dictionary with the audio features of each track. Spotify's API provides access to a variety of audio features. We will extract the following 10 features for each track:

- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Loudness
- Speechiness
- Tempo
- Valence
- Popularity

**Note:** For more detailed information on these audio features, visit [Spotify's Web API Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-tracks).

### 1. Defining the Feature Extraction Function

Start by defining a function, `song_features`, which takes `album` as its parameter. Within this function, initialize empty lists for each audio feature:

```python
def song_features(album):
    lorde_albums[album]['acousticness'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['danceability'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['energy'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['instrumentalness'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['liveness'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['loudness'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['speechiness'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['tempo'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['valence'] = []
    lorde_albums[album]['popularity'] = []
```

### 2. Looping Through Tracks and Extracting Features

Inside the function, iterate over the track URIs in the dictionary and extract each track's audio features and popularity:

- Utilize Spotipy's `audio_features` and `track` functions to gather data.

```python
for track_uri in lorde_albums[album]['uri']:
    features = sp.audio_features(track_uri)[0]
    popularity = sp.track(track_uri)['popularity']

    # Appending each feature to its corresponding list
    lorde_albums[album]['acousticness'].append(features['acousticness'])
    lorde_albums[album]['danceability'].append(features['danceability'])
    lorde_albums[album]['energy'].append(features['energy'])
    lorde_albums[album]['instrumentalness'].append(features['instrumentalness'])
    lorde_albums[album]['liveness'].append(features['liveness'])
    lorde_albums[album]['loudness'].append(features['loudness'])
    lorde_albums[album]['speechiness'].append(features['speechiness'])
    lorde_albums[album]['tempo'].append(features['tempo'])
    lorde_albums[album]['valence'].append(features['valence'])
    lorde_albums[album]['popularity'].append(popularity)
```

### 3. Applying the Function to Each Album

With the function defined, apply it to each album in your dictionary:

```python
for album in lorde_albums:
    song_features(album)
```

- This loop ensures that the `song_features` function processes each album and extracts the desired audio features for every track.

### 4. Testing the Extraction Process

Run the cell to verify the successful execution of the feature extraction process. This will populate your dictionary with the audio features of each track from the albums.

# Transform the Dictionary into a DataFrame

The final step involves converting the dictionary containing all our track data into a well-structured DataFrame. This transformation is necessary to facilitate better visualization and analysis of the data.

### 1. Initializing the DataFrame Structure

Begin by creating an empty dictionary to serve as the foundation for our DataFrame. Then, initialize empty lists for each column we plan to include:

```python
lorde_df = {
    'name': [],
    'album': [],
    'track_number': [],
    'id': [],
    'uri': [],
    'acousticness': [],
    'danceability': [],
    'energy': [],
    'instrumentalness': [],
    'liveness': [],
    'loudness': [],
    'speechiness': [],
    'tempo': [],
    'valence': [],
    'popularity': []
}
```

### 2. Populating the DataFrame

Use nested loops to iterate through each album and its features in the `lorde_albums` dictionary:

```python
for album in lorde_albums:
    for i in range(len(lorde_albums[album]['name'])):
        lorde_df['name'].append(lorde_albums[album]['name'][i])
        lorde_df['album'].append(album)
        lorde_df['track_number'].append(lorde_albums[album]['track_number'][i])
        lorde_df['id'].append(lorde_albums[album]['id'][i])
        lorde_df['uri'].append(lorde_albums[album]['uri'][i])
        lorde_df['acousticness'].append(lorde_albums[album]['acousticness'][i])
        lorde_df['danceability'].append(lorde_albums[album]['danceability'][i])
        lorde_df['energy'].append(lorde_albums[album]['energy'][i])
        lorde_df['instrumentalness'].append(lorde_albums[album]['instrumentalness'][i])
        lorde_df['liveness'].append(lorde_albums[album]['liveness'][i])
        lorde_df['loudness'].append(lorde_albums[album]['loudness'][i])
        lorde_df['speechiness'].append(lorde_albums[album]['speechiness'][i])
        lorde_df['tempo'].append(lorde_albums[album]['tempo'][i])
        lorde_df['valence'].append(lorde_albums[album]['valence'][i])
        lorde_df['popularity'].append(lorde_albums[album]['popularity'][i])
```

### 3. Creating the DataFrame

Convert the dictionary into a pandas DataFrame and adjust the index to start from 1:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(lorde_df)
df.index += 1
```

### 4. Displaying the DataFrame

To view the DataFrame, simply execute:

```python
print(df)
```

### 5. Exporting to CSV

To export the DataFrame to a CSV file, use pandas' `to_csv` function:

```python
df.to_csv('lorde_spotify_data.csv')
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a DataFrame containing your chosen artist's Spotify data. This DataFrame is now ready for further analysis or visualization.
