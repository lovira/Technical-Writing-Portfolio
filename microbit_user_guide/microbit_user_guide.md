    - **Accelerometer**: Detects and measures movement of the micro:bit in three dimensions. Useful for motion-activated projects, such as creating a tilt-controlled game.
    - **Magnetometer (Compass)**: Detects and measures the Earth's magnetic field, allowing the micro:bit to detect direction. Useful in orientation-based projects or simple navigation tools.
    - **Temperature:** Detects and measures the air temperature. Useful for temperature-based projects such as a thermometer or a simple environment data logger.
    - **Light sensor:** Detects and measures the light level. Useful for light-based projects such as a simple light alarm or a nightlight.
    - **Capacitive touch sensor:**  Detects and measures touch interactions. Useful for touch-enabled projects such as creating a touch-activated display.
- **Input/Output (I/O) Pins**: The edge connector at the bottom of the micro:bit provides 25 external connections, including 2 power rings, 3 General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) rings, which can be used to connect a wide range of external components like sensors, motors, and more.
- **Wireless Communication**:
    
    The micro:bit has two wireless communication features:
    
    - **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: Enables the micro:bit to communicate wirelessly with other bluetooth-enabled devices.
    - **Radio**: Allows communication with other micro:bit devices.
- **Sound**
    
    Output
    
    - **Built-in Speaker**: The micro:bit is equipped with a built-in speaker that can be used to produce various sounds.
    
    Input
    
    - Microphone: The micro:bit is equipped with a built-in microphone that can be used to capture and measure sound input.
- **Power Supply Options**: The micro:bit can be powered through USB or an external battery source.
- **USB Interface:** Programs can be downloaded from a computer to the micro:bit with a micro USB.
- **Programming Editors**
    
    The micro:bit supports both block-based and text-based editors.
    
    - **Block-Based Coding**: Ideal for beginners, block-based coding simplifies programming by using color-coded, drag-and-drop blocks that allows users to visually construct the program in blocks.
    - **Text-Based Coding**: For those more experienced, the micro:bit supports text-based programming in various languages such as Python, C++ and more.
